##Load Packages
```{r load packages, message=F, warning=F}
library(tidyverse) #load the tidyverse
library(here) #load the here() package to source function 
# Note: the here() library should capture your local filepath up to the point where the repo begins and is downloaded from github. 
```

##Function
```{r load function}
#Source the function, which is located in the same folder as this rmd:
source("fish_revenue_edits.R", local = FALSE, echo = FALSE) 

```
 

##Data
Generate the input data for the function  

Inputs:  
 * prices for different fish  
 * number of each fish species caught by location  
 
```{r create data, warning=F}

### Create the first input of prices for different fish:
#Create a vector of possible fish
possible_fish <- c("cod", "tuna", "halibut", "salmon", "bass", "grouper", "rockfish")  

#Assign prices for the different fish - let's say prices vary from $3/lb to $30/lb
prices <- runif(length(possible_fish),3,30)

#Combine to make the table:
#The input data frame needs to have the first column be the fish, and the second column be the prices
fish_prices <- data.frame(fish = possible_fish, price = prices)

#fish_prices is the input data frame for fish prices (price_data in the function)

### Creating the second input of total fish caught for each species at different locations
#Each location should be a column 
catch_data <- data.frame("Alaska" = rep(NA, 7), "California" = rep(NA, 7), "Mexico" = rep(NA, 7), "North_Carolina" = rep(NA, 7),
                    "Maine" = rep(NA, 7))
#Each of the seven fish should be a different row:
for(i in 1:7){
  catch_data$Alaska[i] <- round(runif(1, 10,200), 0)
  catch_data$California[i] <- round(runif(1, 10,200), 0)
  catch_data$Mexico[i] <- round(runif(1, 10,200), 0)
  catch_data$North_Carolina[i] <- round(runif(1, 10,200), 0)
  catch_data$Maine[i] <- round(runif(1, 10,200), 0)
}

rownames(catch_data) <- possible_fish #add the names of the fish to the rows

#catch_data is the input data for catch by location (catch_data in the function)
```


```{r run-function}
#run the function
fish_results <- fish_revenue(catch_data = catch_data, price_data = fish_prices, showplot = F)

#view the revenue results, which are stored as the first list in the results:
fish_results[[1]]
```


##Graph Output

If the user specifies showplot = TRUE, the function will generate plot of fishery revenues by location with the total fishery revenue across all locations as a caption.  

```{r function-plot}
#run the function again with showplot = T
fish_result2 <- fish_revenue(catch_data = catch_data, price_data = fish_prices, showplot = TRUE)

#view the plot, which is stored as the second list in the results:
fish_result2[[2]]
```
