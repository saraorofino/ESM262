##Load Packages
```{r packages}
library(tidyverse)
```


##Function
 

##Data
Generate the input data for the function  

Inputs:  
 * prices for different fish  
 * number of each fish species caught by location  
 
```{r data, warning=FALSE}
#Create a vector of possible fish
possible_fish <- c("cod", "tuna", "halibut", "salmon", "bass", "grouper", "rockfish")  

#Assign prices for the different fish - let's say prices vary from $3/lb to $30/lb
prices <- runif(length(possible_fish),3,30)

#Create the input table of fish and prices:
fish.prices <- data.frame(fish = possible_fish, price = prices)

#Randomly draw 200 fish at each of the five locations:
catch = data.frame(Alaska = rep(NA,200), California = rep(NA, 200), Mexico = rep(NA, 200),
                   Maine = rep(NA, 200), North_Carolina = rep(NA, 200))

for(i in 1:200){
  catch$Alaska[i] <- sample(possible_fish, size=1,replace=T)
  catch$California[i] <- sample(possible_fish, size=1, replace=T)
  catch$Mexico[i] <- sample(possible_fish, size=1, replace=T)
  catch$Maine[i] <- sample(possible_fish, size=1, replace=T)
  catch$North_Carolina[i] <- sample(possible_fish, size=1, replace=T)
}

##To - Do: make a df that has one column for each location with the fish species as rows and the number of each fish caught at each location as the column values

```

##Run Function
```{r run-function}
source("fish_revenue.R")

fish_results <- fish_revenue(fish_data = catch, fish_prices = fish.prices)
```


##Graph Output

Graph of revenue by location and total revenue (text)
