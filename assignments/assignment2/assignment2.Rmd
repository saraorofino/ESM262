##Load Packages
```{r load packages}
library(tidyverse) #load the tidyverse
library(here) #load the here() library to source function. the here() library should capture your local filepath up to the point where the repo begins and is downloaded from github. 
```

##Function
```{r load function}
source(here(),"assignments/assignment2/fish_revenue.R", local = FALSE, echo = FALSE) #here() should get your local filepath all the way to "ESM262", and the rest gets you to the function script
fish_revenue
```
 

##Data
Generate the input data for the function  

Inputs:  
 * prices for different fish  
 * number of each fish species caught by location  
 
```{r create data, warning=FALSE}

#creating the data table with prices of each fish

#Create a vector of possible fish
possible_fish <- c("cod", "tuna", "halibut", "salmon", "bass", "grouper", "rockfish")  

#Assign prices for the different fish - let's say prices vary from $3/lb to $30/lb
prices <- runif(length(possible_fish),3,30)

#Create the input table of fish and prices:
fish_prices <- data.frame(fish = possible_fish, price = prices)

fish_prices #this is the input data frame for fish prices

#now, creating the data table for total fish caught for each species at different locations, with each location being a column and each fish a row

#Create a vector of locations:
places <- c("Alaska", "California", "Mexico", "North Carolina", "Maine")

#Create the second input table - number of fish species caught in each location

#I would like to have all the possible fish for every location, start with a list and then cross to get all combinations
catch_list <- list(location = places, fish = possible_fish) %>% cross()

#For each of the combinations draw the catch and then add it to the results list
catch_all <- list() #empty list to store for loop results
for(i in 1:length(catch_list)){
  dat <- as.data.frame(matrix(unlist(catch_list[i]), ncol = 2)) #take the first combination from the list, keep 2 columns
  dat$catch <- rnorm(1,mean=300000,sd=50000) #draw the catch from a normal distribution
  catch_all[[i]] <- dat #save it as a list in the catch_all
}

#Bind all the rows of the lists into one dataframe and update the column names
catch <- bind_rows(catch_all)
colnames(catch) <- c("location", "fish", "catch")

#now, spread the data to make each location a column and each row a fish

catch <- spread(catch, location, catch)

rownames(catch) <- catch[,1]

catch <- catch %>% 
  select("Alaska", "California", "Maine", "Mexico", "North Carolina")

```
