##Load Packages
```{r load packages}
library(tidyverse) #load the tidyverse
library(here) #load the here() library to source function. the here() library should capture your local filepath up to the point where the repo begins and is downloaded from github. 
```

##Function
```{r load function}
source(here(),"assignments/assignment2/fish_revenue.R", local = FALSE, echo = FALSE) #here() should get your local filepath all the way to "ESM262", and the rest gets you to the function script
fish_revenue
```
 

##Data
Generate the input data for the function  

Inputs:  
 * prices for different fish  
 * number of each fish species caught by location  
 
```{r create data, warning=FALSE}

#creating the data table with prices of each fish

#Create a vector of possible fish
possible_fish <- c("cod", "tuna", "halibut", "salmon", "bass", "grouper", "rockfish")  

#Assign prices for the different fish - let's say prices vary from $3/lb to $30/lb
prices <- runif(length(possible_fish),3,30)

#Create the input table of fish and prices:
fish_prices <- data.frame(fish = possible_fish, price = prices)

fish_prices #this is the input data frame for fish prices

#now, creating the data table for total fish caught for each species at different locations, with each location being a column and each fish a row
catch_data <- data.frame("Alaska" = rep(NA, 7), "California" = rep(NA, 7), "Mexico" = rep(NA, 7), "North_Carolina" = rep(NA, 7),
                    "Maine" = rep(NA, 7))

for(i in 1:7){
  catch_data$Alaska[i] <- round(runif(1, 10,200), 0)
  catch_data$California[i] <- round(runif(1, 10,200), 0)
  catch_data$Mexico[i] <- round(runif(1, 10,200), 0)
  catch_data$North_Carolina[i] <- round(runif(1, 10,200), 0)
  catch_data$Maine[i] <- round(runif(1, 10,200), 0)
}

rownames(catch_data) <- possible_fish
```
