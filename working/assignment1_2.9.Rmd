##Why this Course

I'm completing the Environmental Data Science focus and this is one of the required class. I'm interested in learning how to write my own R packages and ways to make data analysis in R more advanced.   

##Data Science Background

I started learning how to use R/RStudio and Git/GitHub last year when I started at Bren. Since then I've taken both of Allison's data courses and started working on a data-based research project with Mark Buntaine. In this project I have brought together about 15 data sets, wrangled them into one analysis data frame, and completed a regression analysis. My group project is also heavily based in R and with my teammates I created a model comprised of a few functions that have time interval loops within them. I have also taken both of Frew's GIS classes and we did a bit of command line coding with git as well as publishing maps to github.
